##Download

Just download the executable from here: [https://github.com/LightSnowDev/Spofy-XL/releases/latest](https://github.com/LightSnowDev/Spofy-XL/releases/latest)


##Based on..
The original [Winfy](https://github.com/maximilian-krauss/Winfy) is not working anymore. So [eltoncezar](https://github.com/eltoncezar/Spofy) revived the application. This is a fork of the revived application. 
This application uses [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) for all Spotify related operations.

##Goal
This fork should enable Spofiy users to have a nice fullscreen display of their current song. Perfect for a second screen.

## Features
* View the current playing track in a comfy way
* Play, pause and skip tracks without opening Spotify
* 3 differents sizes (at this moment)
* Always on top (customizable)
* Growl notifications (if available)

##Changes to eltoncezars Spofy
 * Support Windows 10
 * added fullscreen mode

## Requirements
* Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10)
* .NET Framework 4.5 (or higher)
* Internet connection
* Spotify

## Notice and known bugs
Spofy is **not** a Spotify **replacement**. You need both running at the same time.
* Scaling issues
* performance issues
