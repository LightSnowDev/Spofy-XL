Since [Winfy](https://github.com/maximilian-krauss/Winfy) is not working anymore, I decided to create something similar, but new.

This application uses [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) for all Spotify related operations.

## Features
* View the current playing track in a comfy way
* Play, pause and skip tracks without opening Spotify
* 3 differents sizes (at this moment)
* Always on top (customizable)
* Growl notifications (if available)

## Requirements
* Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10)
* .NET Framework 4.5 (or higher)
* Internet connection
* Spotify

## Notice
Spofy is **not** a Spotify **replacement**. You need both running at the same time.
